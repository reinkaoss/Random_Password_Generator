# Random Password Generator

## Description

In order to produce a random sequence of characters based on user input, this project gathers various sets of arrays holding various types of characters and concatenates their values.
This project's main objective is to use many arrays combined into a single random collection of data while adhering to best coding standards such as "Don't repeat yourself."
In creating this project, I became acquainted for the first time with DOM elements, array concatenation, and random value generation.
